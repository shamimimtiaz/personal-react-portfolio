Upon load the portfolio, I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
On header I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
On the navigation titles, I am presented with the titles Home, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
Once I click on a navigation title, I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
In Portfolio section I am presented titled images of six of the developerâ€™s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.
In Contact section, I am presented a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
